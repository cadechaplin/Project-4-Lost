# Project-4-Lost

We aim to develop an intelligent route planning and scheduling system for delivery agents that optimizes delivery routes while considering multiple real-world constraints. The system will handle time windows, traffic conditions, and multiple delivery locations to minimize travel time and maximize delivery efficiency. We will use A* algorithm to find the optimal route when regarding all these possible factors. For simulating the road network, we will use Google OR-Tools to model the network and Solomon VRPTW Benchmark Solutions to test the network in different scheduling windows and traffic conditions.
